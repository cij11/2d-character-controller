# 2d-character-controller

2.5d implementation of Sebastian Lague's character-controller, using cubes and 3d physics functions instead of 2d.

To implement:
Add Player and Controller2D scripts to a player Cube.
Add a Player collision layer, and assign to the player Cube.
Add an obstacle collision-layer, and assign to the terrain/obstacle objects.
Set the obstacle collision layer as the collision mask in the inspector for the Controller2D.
